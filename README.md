# AsyncTaskQueue
Asynchronous task queue made easy.

The main goal for this library is to make it easier for async tasks to be queued and executed in the order they were created. It was initially conceived as part of another project to help me keep data synchronized with our backend servers.

**Disclaimer:** This library is in a very early stage. In it's current implementation, it is poorly documented, doesn't contain any unit tests and isn't even available in Cocoapods/Carthage. Objective-C compatibility isn't guaranteed right now.

## Compatibility

* Swift 3.0
* Xcode 8.3.x

## Getting Started

For now, simply drag the source files into your Xcode project and you're ready to go. Alternatively, you can add the library project as subproject of your own and set it up as dependency manually.

## Contributing

Feel free to create issues or pull requests. I'll do my best to keep in touch and update the repo as soon as possible.
